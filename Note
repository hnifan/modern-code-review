Q & A and Note
Q :  Why does char game[3][3] = {' '}; not initialize the whole array with spaces?
A : Because {' '} only initializes the first element with ' ', and the rest are filled with '\0' (null character), not ' '.
    The correct way is to use a loop, for example:
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
        game[i][j] = ' ';

Q : Why should we use i-1 and j-1 as array indices instead of i and j?
A : Because user input is in the range 1..3, while C++ arrays use indices 0..2.
    If you directly use i and j, it may cause an out-of-bounds error.
    It should be changed to:
    game[i-1][j-1] = 'X';  // or 'O'

Q : Why does if (i == 3) fail to correctly check for a tie?
A : Because i is the row coordinate entered by the user, not the number of moves. Even at the last move, i may not equal 3.
    We should use the counter n to check if all 9 moves are made, for example:
    if (n == 8 && !isWin(game)) 
        cout << "Tie!" << endl;

Q : Why there is not the duplicate step check?
A : This is the mission of the syntax、logics and I/O
